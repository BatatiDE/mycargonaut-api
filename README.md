# MyCargonaut Backend

This is the backend for the MyCargonaut application, built using **Spring Boot** with Kotlin. It serves as the API and database layer, handling REST and GraphQL endpoints for the platform.

---

## **Setup Instructions**

Follow these steps to set up the backend on your local machine:

### **Prerequisites**
- **Java 17** or later installed.
- **Gradle** (comes with the project via `gradlew`).
- Optional: **Postman** or similar tools for testing endpoints.

---

### **Steps to Run**

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the backend repository from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Build the Project**  
   Use the Gradle wrapper to build the project:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

3. **Run the Backend**  
   Execute the following command to run the Spring Boot application:
   ```bash
   java -jar build/libs/backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```
   By default, the backend runs on `http://localhost:8080`.

4. **Test Endpoints**
    - **REST Endpoint**: Use a browser or Postman to test the REST API (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).
    - **GraphQL Endpoint**: Test the GraphQL API by sending POST requests to `http://localhost:8080/graphql`.

5. **Authentication**
    - During startup, Spring Security generates a password for the default user.
    - Check the console output for a message like:
      ```
      Using generated security password: <password>
      ```
    - Use this password with the username `user` for authentication when accessing secured endpoints.

## **Project Structure**

- `controllers`: Contains the API endpoints (e.g., `ExampleController.kt`).
- `entities`: JPA entity classes for database modeling.
- `repositories`: Spring Data JPA interfaces for database access.
- `services`: Contains business logic.
- `resources/graphql`: Contains `.graphqls` schema files.

---

## **Endpoints**

### REST
- `/`: Example endpoint that returns `Welcome to MyCargonaut!`.
